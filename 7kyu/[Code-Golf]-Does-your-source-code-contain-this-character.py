# Given a character, return True if your source code (the one from
# solution tab) contains this character or False if it doesn't.
# Example
#
# d('d')  # probably True, because the name of the function is 'd',
# unless you obfuscate it
#
# Importing is disabled. You also may not use open('solution.py') to
# fetch your code from the file system, that's cheating.
#
# Keep your code short (under 33 characters)
# Restricted
# Metaprogramming


d=lambda d:d in r"\"d=:lamb rin"


# Best solutions:


d='\.count\'d='.count


d='\'\\d=_contais.'.__contains__


d=lambda d:d in'\'=am\\blind 3:'
