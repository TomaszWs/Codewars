# Story
#
# ejiniÊàòÁ•û has recently quit his programming job and is now opting in for a
# career change. He has decided to settle in the baking industry and is now a
# worker of a cake franchise designated for wedding celebrations. He has come
# up with a creative wedding cake model and a unique box that can modify the
# cake in a certain way that can blow away all the attendees!!! (How cool is
# that~ üòè)
# Task
#
# Given the cake model, your job is to help ejiniÊàòÁ•û write a program that can
# instantly display the final visualization of the cake model after the unique
# box has been unfolded.
#
# Initial cake model below:
#
#     /|\
#    \/ \/
#   \ | | \
#   /\/\/\/
#  /       \
# /|||||||||\
#
# The final visualization:
#
#     /|\
#    \ | /
#   \  |  \
#   /  |  /
#  /   |   \
# /    |    \
#
# More examples:
#
#           \         \
#         // |||||||||\\/
#        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
#        / /| \ /\|\ /| |/
#     /||||||||\/| /\||||||\\
#
#     becomes
#
#           \    |    \
#         /      |      /
#        \       |       \
#        /       |       /
#     /          |          \
#
#        /         \
#        /         \
#        /         \
#        /         \
#        /         \
#        /         \
#
#     becomes

#        /    |    \
#        /    |    \
#        /    |    \

# Notes
#
#     Each cake model will have at least 1 layer (row), separated by a newline
#     character (\n)
#     Each layer will only consist of odd number of filling space
#     The lower layer will have equal or more filling space than the upper ones
#     Each layer will always start and end with / or \ fillings
#     Starting and ending position of each layer will not overlap
#     Inner fillings of the cake may be /, \ or |
#     Some part of the cake do not have fillings (due to the semi-functional
#     cake creation model...)
#     Trailing and leading spaces for the visualization above will not be
#     included in the cake model's input and final output.
#     \\ for visualization above only is considered as 2 fillings rather than
#     1.
#     Output should be the same as the given input except with all fillings of
#     each layer centralized whilst leaving a starting and ending filling to
#     prevent it from overflow ^^. (Refer to examples above)
