# There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same
# and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three
# arguments:
#
#     number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);
#     distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
#     width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).
#
# Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters
# (without the width of the first and last pillar).


def pillars(num_pill, dist, width):
    if num_pill == 1:
        return 0
    return (num_pill - 1) * dist * 100 + (num_pill - 2) * width


if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(pillars(1, 10, 10))


# Best solutions:


def pillars(num_pill, dist, width):
    return dist * 100 * (num_pill - 1) + width * (num_pill - 2) * (num_pill > 1)


def pillars(num_pill, dist, width):
    return dist * 100 * (num_pill - 1) + width * (num_pill - 2) * (num_pill > 1)
