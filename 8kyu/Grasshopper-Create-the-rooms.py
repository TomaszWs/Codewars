# Escape the room
#
# You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a
# hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There
# should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least
# three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).


rooms = {"1": {"name": 1, "description": 1, "completed": 1},
         "2": {"name": 1, "description": 1, "completed": 1},
         "3": {"name": 1, "description": 1, "completed": 1}}


if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(rooms)
