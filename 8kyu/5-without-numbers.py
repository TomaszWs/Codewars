# Write a function that always returns 5
#
# Sounds easy right? Just bear in mind that you can't use any of the following characters: 0123456789*+-/

# Good luck :)


def unusual_five():
    return len("fives")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(unusual_five())


# Best solutions:


def unusual_five():
    return 'Support Ukraine!'.index('r')


def unusual_five():
    return(len('aaaaa'))
