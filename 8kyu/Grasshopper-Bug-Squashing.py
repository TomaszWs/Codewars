# Terminal game bug squashing
#
# You are creating a text-based terminal version of your favorite board game.
# In the board game, each turn has six steps that must happen in this order:
# roll the dice, move, combat, get coins, buy more health, and print status.
#
# You are using a library that already has the functions below. Create a
# function named main that calls the functions in the proper order.
#
# - `combat`
# - `buy_health`
# - `get_coins`
# - `print_status`
# - `roll_dice`
# - `move`


from preloaded import *


health = 100
position = 0
coins = 0


def main():
    roll_dice()
    move()
    combat()
    get_coins()
    buy_health()
    print_status()


# Best solutions:


health = 100
position = 0
coins = 0


def main():
  [phase() for phase in[roll_dice, move, combat, get_coins, buy_health,
                        print_status]]
